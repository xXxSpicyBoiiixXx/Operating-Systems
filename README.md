# Operating-Systems

This will be my Winter break reading for the year 2020. This is where I will dump a lot of the code as well as some notes I might need in the future. 

The textbook I will be following is "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces". In addition to this textbook I will be following the OS Developer wiki page. 

The textbook and the wiki page I will be following is linked below.
