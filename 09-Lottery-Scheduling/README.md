# Homework (Simulation) 

### Q1: Computer the solutions for simulation with 3 jobs and random seeds of 1,2, and 3.

A1: 

### Q2: Now run with two specific jobs: each of length 10, but one (job 0) with just 1 ticket and the other (job 1) with 100 (e.g. -1 10:1, 10:100). What happens when the number of tickets is so imbalanced? Will job 0 ever run before job 1 completes? How often? In general, what does suhc a ticket imbalance do to the behavior of lottery scheduling? 

A2: 

### Q3: When running with two jobs of length 100 and equal ticket alloca-tions of 100 (-l 100:100,100:100), how unfair is the scheduler?Run with some different random seeds to determine the (probabilis-tic) answer; let unfairness be determined by how much earlieronejob finishes than the other.

A3: 

### Q4: How does your answer to the previous question change as the quan-tum size (-q) gets larger?

A4: 

### Q5: Can you make a version of the graph that is found in the chapter?What else would be worth exploring? How would the graph lookwith a stride scheduler?
